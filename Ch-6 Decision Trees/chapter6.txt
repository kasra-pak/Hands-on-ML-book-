Visualizing Decision Trees:
  sklearn.tree.export_graphviz()

sklearn uses the CART algorithm, which produces only binary trees. other algorithms such as ID3 can
produce Decision Trees with nodes that have more than two children.

Decision Trees are intuitive, and their decisions are easy to interpret. Such models are often called 
white box models. In contrast, as we will see, Random Forests or neural networks are generally 
considered black box models.

A Decision Tree can also estimate the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class k. 
First it traverses the tree to find the leaf node for this instance, and then it returns the ratio of 
training instances of class k in this node.

The CART algorithm works mostly the same way as earlier, except that instead of trying to split the
training set in a way that minimizes impurity, it now tries to split the training set in a way that
minimizes the MSE.
